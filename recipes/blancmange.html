    <p>A lighter version of the classic Blancmange, made with buttermilk for a refreshing tangy zing! 

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>500ml Buttermilk</li>
        <li>185g Sugar</li>
        <li>20ml Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>12g Gelatine Leaf</li>
        <li>500ml Whipping Cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Soak gelatine in cold water until soft and pliable. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Warm buttermilk, sugar and vanilla, just until sugar dissolves (about 60&deg;C), strrring continuously. Careful or the buttermilk will curdle!</li>
        <li>Add gelatine and stir until fully dissolved. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Whip the cream to soft peaks and keep refrigerated until needed.</li>
        <li>Keep an eye on the buttermilk. It needs to set enough that it looks like a soft jelly, but not so much that you can't fold the cream through.
            <br>If it's too hot, the cream will melt and you will get a firm Blancmange. If it's too cold, it will not blend with the cream and will become lumps of jelly in cream.
        <br>Take care!</li>
        <li>When the buttermilk is just setting, fold through the whipped cream, making sure it is evenly dispersed without knocking the air out of it.</li>
        <li>Chill overnight. Serve with fresh fruit or berries.</li>
